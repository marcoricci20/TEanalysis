## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

DATA = fread(file = "Path/Transposable_elements.out", header = F, stringsAsFactors = F, skip = 3, fill = T)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
DATA = DATA[,c(5,6,7,9,10,11,2,15)]
names(DATA) = c("Scaffold", "Begin", "End", "Strand", "Element", "Family", "Divergence", "ID")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
DATA = DATA[DATA$Divergence < 3,]
```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

boo = grepl(pattern = "LINE|SINE", x = DATA$Family)
DATA = DATA[boo,]
```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
table (DATA$Family)

```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
length(unique(DATA$ID))

```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
write.table(x= DATA, file="Path/rescent_non-LTR.out",quote=FALSE,sep="\t",col.names=FALSE,row.names=FALSE)
